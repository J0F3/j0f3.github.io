By default, DPM will create for every data source two volumes (a replica andÂ a shadow copy volume). For Hyper-V and SQL Database DPM can colocation multiple data sources on a single replica an shadow copy volume. This is relatively well known setting.The option is especially useful for backup a large numbers of Hyper-V VMs.

What is less know, is the possibility to tune the initial size of the replica volume which DPM will choose when a new Protection Group with colocation is created. The default size for Hyper-V VMs is 250 GB what is relatively small if youbacking up a lot of VMs. To change the initial size of the replica volume you can edit the following Registry setting:

```registry
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Data Protection Manager\Collocation\HyperV\CollocatedReplicaSize (DWORD)
```

The value is the size in bytes and should be a multiple of 1073741824 (1GB).

The default value is: 268435456000 (250GB)
So when your backup a lot of VMs you cloud change the value e.g. to 900GB (966367641600) to fit a lot more VMs on the same volume than it would be the case with the default 250GB volume.

There is also a second Key to tune how many VM Backups DPM will colocation on the same volume:

```registry
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Data Protection Manager\Collocation\HyperV\DSCollocationFactor (DWORD)
```
Values between 1 and 8 are possible. MS recommends a value of 3 for large scale environments.
