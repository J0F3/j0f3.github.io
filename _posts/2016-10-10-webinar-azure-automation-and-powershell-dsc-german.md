On Tuesday October 11 2016 at 2pm (CEST) I had a webinar in German about Azure Automation and PowerShell DSC. I explained the basic concepts of Azure Automation, Automation Runbook and PowerShell DSC.

A main part of the webinar was an example scenario to automatically deploy and configure a VM using Azure Automation Runbooks and Azure Automation DSC. I will configure the whole scenario live during the webinar.

When you interested in the scripts, which I am using to configure the scenario, you can get them [here](/assets/downloads/VMDeploymentAA.zip).
