We will show you what the buzzword Infrastructure as Code actually means and how Infrastructure as Code can be used in the real world in real projects and environments. Furthermore we will give you some guidelines how you can leverage DevOps principals for platform and infrastructure automation so you, as an IT Pro, will be ready for the new agile and and fast pacing future of IT.
