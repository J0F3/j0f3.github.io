As an outcome of the Microsoftâ€™s demos about Storage Spaces Direct at Ignite conference and the Intel Developer Forum, Microsoft published recently a bunch of PowerShell Script known as [VMFleet](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/filecab/2016/04/11/diskspd-now-on-github-and-the-mysterious-vmfleet-released/){:target="_blank"}

VMFleet is a basically a collection of PowerShell script to easily create a bunch of VMs and run some stress tests in it (mostly with the DISKSPD tool) to test the performance of an underlying Storage Space Direct deployment or simply for demonstration purposes.

After you have downloaded the files it is not quite obviously how to get started as the included documentation does not give you some simple step by step guidelines how to get all up and running.

So I decided to write my own short guide with the needed steps to get the VMFleet up and running.

**Update 03.01.2017:** Since I wrote&nbsp;this post in May 2016,&nbsp;Microsoft has apparently extended&nbsp;the VMFleet with some new scripts to setup the environment.&nbsp;So I updated the setup steps below.**&nbsp;**Thanks to my colleague and coworker Patrick Mutzner for pointing that out!

# Prerequisites

* VMFleet Files from GitHub: [https://github.com/Microsoft/diskspd](https://github.com/Microsoft/diskspd){:target="_blank"}
* diskspd.exe which is available at [https://aka.ms/diskspd ](https://aka.ms/diskspd ){:target="_blank"}
* A &nbsp;VHDX file with installed Windows Server 2012 R2 / 2016&nbsp;**Core** and the password of the local Administrator account&nbsp;set. (sysprep must not be run!).  A fixed VHDX file is recommended to eliminate &#8220;warmup&#8221; effects when starting the test runs.

    >**Note:** The VHDX should be at least 20GB big because the VMFleet Scripts will create a load test file of 10GB by default.
    {: .notice--warning}
* A functional Storage Spaces Direct Cluster (with existing Storage Pool and no configured Virtual Disks)

# VMFleet Setup

1. First you need to **create one Volume/CSV per node** to store the test VMs.

    ``` powershell
    Get-ClusterNode |% { New-Volume -StoragePoolFriendlyName "S2D*" -FriendlyName $_ -FileSystem CSVFS_ReFS -StorageTierfriendlyNames Performance,Capacity -StorageTierSizes 1TB , 200GB }
    ```

2. Then create **an additional CSV&nbsp;to store the VMFleet scripts** and for the collection of the test results from the VMs.

    ``` powershell
    New-Volume -StoragePoolFriendlyName "*s2d*" -FriendlyName collect -FileSystem CSVFS_ReFS -StorageTierFriendlyNames Capacity -StorageTierSizes 1TB
    ```

3. **Extract the ZIP file with the VMFleet scripts** on one of the cluster nodes.
(For example extract the downloaded ZIP file to C:\Source on the first cluster node)

4. Run the **install-vmfleet.ps1** Script. This will create the needed folder structure on the collect CSV. (The volume created at Step 2)

    ``` powershell
    install-vmfleet.ps1 -source C:\Source
    ```

5. **Copy** the **DISKSPD.exe** to **C:\ClusterStorage\Collect\Control\Tools**
    > **ProTip:** Everything in this folder will later automatically be copied into every test VM. So you can also copy other files to this folder if you need them later inside the test VMs.
    {: .notice--info}

6. **Copy template VHDX** to **C:\ClusterStorage\Collect**

7. **Run** the **update-csv.ps1** (unter C:\ClusterStorage\Collect\Control) script to rename the mountpoints of the CSV volumes and to distribute the CSV even in the cluster so every node is the owner node of exactly one CSV.

    ![updatecsv](/assets/images/update-csv.png)

8. Now itâ€™s time to **create a bunch of test VMs on the four CSVs**. This is done by the **create-vmfleet.ps1** Script.

    ```powershell
    create-vmfleet.ps1 -basevhd 'C:\ClusterStorage\Collect\FleetImage.vhdx' -vms 10 -adminpass P@55w0rd! -connectuser HostAdmin -connectpass HostAdminPass
    ```

    As parameters you must specify the path to the template VHDX file, how many VM per Node you like to create, the Administrator password of the template VHDX and a Username and its Password which has access to the Cluster Nodes (HostAdmin in this example). This account will be used inside the VMs to connect back to the cluster so that the script running inside the VMs get access to the collect CSV (C:\ClusterStorage\collect).

9. Because the create-vmfleet.ps1 creates the VMs with the default values from the New-VM Cmdlet you should run now the **set-vmfleet.ps1** Script **to change the count of vCPUs and the memory size of the test VMs** to your desired values.
```powershell
set-vmfleet.ps1 -ProcessorCount 2 -MemoryStartupBytes 4GB -MemoryMinimumBytes 4GB -MemoryMaximumBytes 4GB
```

10. (Optional) Now before you begin with the tests you can check your Storage Spaces Direct Cluster configuration with the **test-clusterhealth.ps1 script**. The Script will check on all nodes if there are any RDMA configuration errors and it will do some basic health checks of the Storage Spaces Direct setup.

11. As the last preparation step start the **watch-cluster.ps1** script. This will give you a nice dashboard like overview of the most interesting storage performance counters across all nodes in the cluster. So you get an overview of the storage load and performance.

    ![watchcluster](/assets/images/watch-cluster.png)

12. At this Point you are ready to start you first test run. **Simply start all test VMs** manually or with the **start-vmfleet.ps1** script. After the VMs have booted up they will automatically look for the run.ps1 script on the collect CSV (at C:\ClusterStorage\Collect\Control). But by default the test run is in paused state. So **to start the** actual **load test** simply **run** the **clear-pause.ps1** script. This will kick off the dskspd.exe in every VMs and you can observe how the numbers from the watch-cluster.ps1 will explode ðŸ˜‰

To change the test pattern simply change the parameters in the run.ps1 Script and either restart all test VMs (with stop-vmfleet.ps1 and start-vmfleet.ps1 scripts) or pause and resume the tests with the set-pause.ps1 and clear-pause.ps1 scripts.
Thatâ€™s it. VMFleet is ready. So have fun while testing your S2D deployment and while looking at some awesome IOPS numbers. ðŸ˜Š
