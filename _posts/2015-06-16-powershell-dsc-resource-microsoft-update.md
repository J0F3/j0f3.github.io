Ever get tired to manually set the check box for Microsoft Update in the above screen on a bunch of servers (e.g. in a new test lab setup or so)? Then this one is for you. I wrote recently, mostly as an exercise, a PowerShell DSC Module with a resource to enable (or disable) the Microsoft Update.

I have then published the Module von GitHub to get another exercise. üòâ So if you interested you can get the Module from here: [https://github.com/J0F3/cMicrosoftUpdate](https://github.com/J0F3/cMicrosoftUpdate)

>**Note:** The cMicrosoftUpdate resource is integrated in the official Microsoft community resource [xWindowsUpdate](https://github.com/PowerShell/xWindowsUpdate) in the meantime
{: .notice--info}

After you get the module, enabling the Microsoft Update settings will look like this: ![DSCMSUpdate](/assets/images/EnableMSUpdateDSC.png)

Happy DSCing!üòÅ
